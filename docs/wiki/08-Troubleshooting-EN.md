# Troubleshooting

## Service crash-loops / `bind: address already in use`
If `status` shows `activating (auto-restart)` with a rising restart counter, and `logs` shows:
```
server error: listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use
```
the port is already taken — usually by a **Docker container** (e.g. an official PasarGuard panel/node) or a stray instance.
```bash
sudo ss -ltnp 'sport = :8080'      # panel
sudo ss -ltnp 'sport = :62050'     # node: gRPC
sudo ss -ltnp 'sport = :8090'      # node: HTTP control
```
- If it's `docker-proxy`: a container publishes that port. Either stop that container (`docker stop <name>`) or **change our service's port**:
  - Panel: `sudo pg-panel edit-env` → `PANEL_HTTP_ADDR=:2095`
  - Node: `sudo pg-node-agent edit-env` → `PG_AGENT_HTTP_ADDR=:8092` and `PG_AGENT_GRPC_ADDR=:62052` (and set the node's address and "gRPC port" in the panel accordingly).
- If it's a stray `pg-panel`/`pg-node-agent`: `sudo pkill -f /opt/pg-panel/pg-panel` (then `systemctl reset-failed` and `restart`).
- Note: the official PasarGuard node also uses **62050** for gRPC; to install alongside it, change our node's ports.

## Log `Failed to load API Key` or `Failed to load env file`
Harmless. It comes from the upstream base code; the script writes a dummy `API_KEY` to silence it. Multi-tenancy works regardless.

## The node shows offline in the main panel
- Check `sudo pg-node-agent status` and `logs`.
- Did you enter the address correctly? It must be `https://NODE_IP:8090` (not the gRPC one).
- Are firewall ports `8090` (control) and `62050` (gRPC) open?
- Does the pinned cert match the node's current cert? If you ran `renew-cert`, re-pin.

## The panel won't accept the certificate / TLS error when adding a node
- Paste the full `cert_pem` (with BEGIN/END lines).
- Or leave the cert field empty for automatic TOFU.
- If the node cert changed, delete and re-add the node.

## Stale UI after an update (missing buttons)
The browser cached the old `app.js`. Hard-refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R`. (Newer panel versions send no-cache headers so this won't recur.)

## Customer connected in PasarGuard but the user link doesn't work
- The customer's inbound must **match** the node's real inbound: port, protocol, network, SNI/host, TLS. (See [Connect from PasarGuard](05-Customer-Connect-EN)).
- The node's `--force-inbounds` must include the real inbound tag (default `vless-in`).
- View the node config with `sudo pg-node-agent edit` and give the exact parameters to the customer.

## Customer users got disconnected
- Quota/expiry likely ran out. Usage: `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/usage`.
- Restore via `topup-quota` or `renew`. Data returns on renewal (suspend ≠ delete).

## Overage
Because Xray is shared, a little traffic may be recorded after the quota runs out, until enforcement runs. This overage is reported in `GET /customers/{id}/usage` (`overage_bytes`) so the sales bot can settle the wallet. Default enforcement interval is 10s (`PG_AGENT_ENFORCE_INTERVAL`).
